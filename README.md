# Kernel-User Interface for Kernel Internals Visualization

## Project Overview
`kernel-monitor` is a project designed to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing key Linux kernel internals. By developing a Linux kernel module and a user-space application, this project enables the collection and display of critical system statistics such as CPU usage, memory details, and task information, making it easier for developers and system administrators to monitor system health and performance in real-time.

## Project Goals
- **Kernel Module**: Develop a Linux kernel module to gather important kernel internals data such as CPU usage, memory statistics, and task management details.
- **Data Transfer Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism for passing collected kernel data to a user-space application efficiently.
- **User-Space Application**: Create a user-space application that receives the kernel data, processes it, and presents it in a graphical or textual format, offering insights into system performance.

## Features
- **Kernel Internals Data Collection**:
  - CPU usage statistics
  - Memory usage information (e.g., free, used, cached memory)
  - Task/process details (e.g., active tasks, resource consumption)
  
- **User-Friendly Visualization**: 
  - Display kernel data in an organized and easily understandable format
  - Potential for graphical visualizations or textual output with filtering and search capabilities
  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous updates of kernel data for live system monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. A Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
2. Basic understanding of Linux kernel modules and C programming
3. Development tools such as `gcc`, `make`, `kernel headers` (ensure they are installed on your system)
